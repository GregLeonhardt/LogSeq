	- # Update and upgrade the system:
		- Before installing anything you should always update and upgrade.
			- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
	- # PreInstall:
		- ## openjdk-13
			- NOTE: In order to install the C/C++ stuff a java utility 'unpack200' is required. This is difficult because 'unpack200' was deprecated in jdk14. Hence you need JDK13 installed in add C/C++ functionality.

	- # Download and install:

		- Click on the Download button and then on the link of the script that is available for Linux.
		- NOTE: Do this on the target machine to avoid the need to copy it there after downloading.

		- `cd ~/Downloads`
