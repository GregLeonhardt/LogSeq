- When I searched for configuring sendmail on ubuntu I didn't get any clear answer, each of them assume I know what they are talking about,
- I just want basic configuration to enable email sending, basically I will use it with google app engine to enable mail sending from dev server.
- I already did this:
	- `sudo apt-get install sendmail`
- then
	- `sudo sendmailconfig`
- but I don't know what the last one actually does.
