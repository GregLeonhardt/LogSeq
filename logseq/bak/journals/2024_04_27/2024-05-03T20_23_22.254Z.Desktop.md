	- **02:44** While in the ER she had a seizure.  At least that's what the Doctors said and they were there when it happened.
		- It is likely this also happened back at the apartment last night.
		- Not much else to say other than they admitted her to the step down unit on the 5th floor.
		- Nobody is coming up with any theories why this is happening./
