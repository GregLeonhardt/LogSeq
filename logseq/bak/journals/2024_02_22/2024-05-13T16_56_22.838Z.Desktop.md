Sandy was seen in clinic today with Dianna Larson PA and Dr. Manatsathit. 



She is doing well overall. Voice has strengthened since vocal cord injection, and she does not have difficulty swallowing anymore. 



She has had more frequent bowel movements but they are still formed. 



Concerns about bloodshot eye and fragile skin on forearms. 



She is eating 1430-1915 calories a day, 72-90 oz of liquids, and 65-107g protein a day. 



Weight down on our scales to 176#, but has also lost some water weight as well. 



OT is discharging her from their service as her strength has greatly improved. 



Decision was made to decrease TPN to 3 nights a week, she will follow up in clinic in 1 week.



Dr. Manatsathit would like Sandy to have another proBNP checked next week to follow the trend. 



She will return to clinic in 1 week on 2/29/24. 



Notified Cindy HHC RN of decrease of TPN to 3 nights a week and need for additional proBNP.
