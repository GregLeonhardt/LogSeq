	- **10:24** I thought she was on the uphill side but her temperature was 100.6 this morning.  Blood pressure was on the low side, heart rate was on the high side.  I guess we will see what the transplant team has to say this afternoon.  She did drink a Premier Protein and accepted a protein coffee and drank the Premier Protein but only sipped the coffee.
	- **14:17**  Back from the transplant clinic appointment.
		- They are very concerned with the constant elevated temperature and think she should be in the hospital but are stopping short of recommending it.
		- Food intake was good until the fever started.
		- Fluid intake is good but would like to see fewer days of only 70 to 80 and more 100 plus days.
		- Elevated glucose levels are likely a result of the elevated temperatures. (infection)
		- If temperature hits 101 or in the 100 - 101 range for an extended period of time, **GO TO THE ER**.
