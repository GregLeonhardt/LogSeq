		- Sandy was seen in clinic today with Erin Van Surksum PA and Dr. Pradhan. She is doing well overall, 1 year out from her transplant and had a nice trip back to Colorado. She is eating 3 meals a day with one snack. Her weight is stable at 185#. Eating 1300-2000 calories a day and averaging 80 oz of water a day. 
		  
		  
		  
		  Since her creatinine is a bit elevated, and her calorie counts were on the lower side, decision was made to not adjust the TPN. She will continue weekly labs and will return to clinic in 1 week. 
		  
		  
		  
		  Instructed to add another snack a day, and to increased water intake to 100oz a day.
