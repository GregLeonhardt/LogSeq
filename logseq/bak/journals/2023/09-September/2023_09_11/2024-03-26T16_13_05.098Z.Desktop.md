	- Much better today.  Virtually all signs of the infection yesterday are gone.  Infectious Dieses is looking at the specific anti bacteria drug and duration if infusion to try and combat the bug more effectively.  The tests from yesterday showed the same bugs as before.
	- The scans from Friday, or Saturday, are showing stones or debris in or around the bile duct.  I don't understand the ins and outs of the whole thing but they want to go in and clean it out but the TIPS is complicating getting that done.  The gastro team is reviewing plans and alternative routs.  Probably will be doing something tomorrow or Wednesday.
