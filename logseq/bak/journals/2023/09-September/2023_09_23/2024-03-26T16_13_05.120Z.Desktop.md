# #Sandy
	- Today was [[Speech]] (memory, etc.) evaluation.  Overall she is good but gets stuck on words from time to time.  Also has a tendency of not following directions where she will make assumptions to what is being asked.
	- That is about it.  Oh, Lunch came and it wasn't something that she wanted so she had me go out to Jersey Mike's for a sandwich.  In the end she ate a small fraction of the in house food and almost nothing of the sandwich I went to get.
	- Other than the above She was in bed most of the day watching TV.  [Still an improvement from even last week where she would sleep 20 hours a day.]  An improvement is an improvement.
