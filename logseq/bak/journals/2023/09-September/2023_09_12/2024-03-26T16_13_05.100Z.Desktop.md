76.9 Kg. 169.18 Lb. [+12.1] Bed Weight *
	- This would be a stabilized weight from last Saturday.  Is it possible that her weight swings are this erratic?
	- Every day she is getting stronger and stronger.  Don't get me wrong she is still extremely weak.  As an example last week she needed help getting her feet off the bed when she was getting up, today she can do it herself.  Last week when doing her exercises she could hardly lift her foot, today it goes a couple of inches.  Like I said, forward progress but still a long way to go.
