# #Sandy
	- Released from the hospital today and transferred to Madonna Rehab.
	- The facility looks new [about 7 years since opening].  We had a continuous line of people coming through for the 'check-in' process.  The doctor impressed me with the degree he attempted to understand Sandy's case.  Tomorrow starts the assessments for [[PT]], [[OT]] , and [[Speech]] therapy.  Then a plan for  how to get her strength and endurance back.
	- With the improvements she has had over the past week I don't think she will be there long.  Maybe two (2) weeks.
