	- That is a big weight loss for one day, but I can see it in her arms so I am believing the number.
	- I walked in this morning and #Sandy is Shivering.  High blood pressure 163/?? and heart rate is back in the 105's.  Also her temperature normal but she is freezing and eventually the clear snot starts running from the nose.  About the time all the blood tests are done (blood draw for), she settles down.
