- Tylenol has been controlling the fever and blood tests have come back positive for Cytomegalovirus (CMV).  (Future me speaking here:  I am not clear if this is from the transplanted organs or a triggered response from the transplant itself.)  This is something that is relatively common in transplant patients.  The disturbing piece is that her viral load was extremely high.  More than one doctor has commented that it is among the highest levels they have ever seen.  The good news is that they know what is causing the fever and are starting to treat it.  It took a couple of days to figure out what the cause is because her IVIG was masking the virus.  As I understand it they look for a drop in levels of something in the blood that is atrificially high from her infusions.  Since the levels didn’t drop they didn’t suspect CMV.  As time went on someone connected the dots and figured it out.  I guess this is one of the reasons the other two places didn’t want to transplant her.
