# #Sandy
	- Backfill history from before I started Journaling.
		- Sandy started to drift into what to me looked like encephalopathy.  It turned out to be a buildup of CO2 in her blood stream.  There were two primary causes.  Number one was ascites with excessive fluid in the abdomen.  After paracentesis removing 4.4 liters of fluid is the temporary solution.  Number two was placing her on a BiPAT (intubation with a mask instead of a tube down the through) respiration device the CO2 levels came back down.
