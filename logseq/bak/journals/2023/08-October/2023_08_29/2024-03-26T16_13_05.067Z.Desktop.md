77.8 Kg. 171.16 Lb. [- 1.32] Bed Weight
	- Still no discussion of when #Sandy will be released from the hospital (to rehab).
	- Her liver numbers are rising slightly.  Nothing to be all that concerned about but they are going in the wrong direction.  The team believes this is being triggered by the water pills she is taking to pee out the excess fluid.  They have stopped the water pills to a) attempt to improve the liver numbers. b) see what effect it has on her weight.
	- She actually eat something (other than sugar coted whatever) for lunch today.  It wasn't much more than a half cup but even that is way more than she has eaten in the past few weeks COMBINED.
