- Slightly more awake than yesterday but will still fall asleep if left alone for more than a few minutes.
- Depressed.  "I just hate living like this." in the bed relying on people to assist getting up etc.
- On the positive side, the lab tests are coming back very positive.  Not perfect but the things they are paying attention to are trending in the right direction.  Especially her oxygen.  Before coming over to step-down ICU and the BiPAT her oxygen was low 90's on 3 liters of oxygen.  Now it's upper 90's and no oxygen.
