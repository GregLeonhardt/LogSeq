	- Spent the morning getting ready for the TIPS procedure.  All washed up and morning medicine.
	- The switch from feed tube to IV feeding started last night.  It is just a big bag of fluid that is pumped through one of the midlines.  When we were talking to Misty yesterday afternoon she said that the specific formula can be altered as needed.  If #Sandy tests low for magnesium they will add a little magnesium, etc.
	- The TIPS went well and a new IV ? Main Line ? was inserted for the TPN feeding system.  While she was there they did another paracentesis removing 1.1 liter of fluid.
