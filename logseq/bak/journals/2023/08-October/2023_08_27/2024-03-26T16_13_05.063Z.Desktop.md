	- Sandy is doing better even though she will not take the initiative to exercise.  She will almost always do what is asked of her but will not do anything on her own.  She is in better spirit and more or less accepted that she is going into rehab when released from the hospital.  And still not eating anything.  The consequence of not eating is the IV nutrition which is adding fluid faster than she can pee it out.

	  A pretty goodnight sleeping.  As usual I had to go the the bathroom once (maybe twice) but promptly went back to sleep.  I recall having some weird dreams but absolutely nothing about them.
	- I eat WAY too much tonight.  Made chicken barest and only eat a little more than half.  Then the snacking started and just kept on going.  I have to stop eating like that.
