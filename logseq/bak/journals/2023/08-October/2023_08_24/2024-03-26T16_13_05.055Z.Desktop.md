78.5 Kg. 172.70 Lb. [- 9.90] *Standing Weight
	- We are back to a real scale so the weight has a big change but it isn't real.  But it is down from last week, the last time she was on a standing scale.
	- Three good walks today.  The first two were about the same distance as yesterday but the last one was twice the distance.  Moving in bed a little easier and getting up and down is also easier.  Still needs assistance but not as much.
	- Will still fall asleep if left alone for more than a few minutes but wide awake when there is anything going on.
