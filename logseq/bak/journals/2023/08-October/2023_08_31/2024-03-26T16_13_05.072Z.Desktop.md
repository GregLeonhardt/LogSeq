	- Yesterday was the result of a UTI caused by ?? who knows ??.  Largely explained by hospitals are not clean and on top of her immune deficiency they are suppressing it.
	- She is kind of wiped out today which was expected.
	- A rep from the rehab place stopped by and said:
		- They have two levels of care; medical and full acquit rehab.  She was thinking the medical would be more suitable for #Sandy but the doctors will get together and make that decision.
		  Medicare is good for 150 days of hospitalization and #Sandy is on day 115.  Her Humana should kick in to cover any overage.
