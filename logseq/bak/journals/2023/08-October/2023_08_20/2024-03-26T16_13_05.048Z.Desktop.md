# #Sandy
	- Haven't seen a weight yet but one of the Dr. said that she peed two liters so the weight should be down from yesterday.
	- Nothing but good news from the doctors on rounds, though I am starting to think that they (Dr. Langnas) was on the fence for the TIPS.  They are constantly evaluating #Sandy for encephalopathy which would be one of the negative side effects of the TIPS.  Anyhow, Blood gases are looking good. O2 is showing 90 - 92 and she is sleeping and no oxygen.  Not stellar numbers but a couple days ago it was 92 - 94 on 3 liters of oxygen was she was awake.
	- While everything above is positive I am still very worried. She is still sleeping all the time, not eating and she is resisting doing all the things everybody tells her she needs to do to get better.
	- 84.4 Kg. 185.68 Lb. [+ 4.40] *Bed Weight
	- Well that was unexpected.  I am guessing they went with bed weight and since it is cold in the room today and there are a few blankets on the bed the weight is reading high.
