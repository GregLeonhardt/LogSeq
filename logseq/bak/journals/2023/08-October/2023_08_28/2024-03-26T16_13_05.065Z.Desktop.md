78.4 Kg. 172.48 Lb. [- 2.64] Bed Weight
	- It may be bed weight but the trend for the past couple of days is down.  And that is a good thing.
	- Soo much better today.  With the bed raised she can stand up without any help and with only a little assistance can get up from the toilet.  Walking matched what she did on Friday.
	- A bit of a scare this afternoon.  Her blood glucose measured in at 42, which is VERY low.  after a couple cups of apple juice it came up to 86 but an hour later it was back down to 64.

	  I have been working on Recipes.For.MC in an attempt to clean up the mess.  After a few restarts (delete all changes and restore form backup) I think the plan is to only delete stuff that doesn't contain anything resembling a recipe.  Precious attempts I was attempting to delete stuff that I didn't 'think' would make it through the recipe scanner.  I believe it is as much work attempting to pre-scan the e-mail as it would be to actually look at the reformatted results.
