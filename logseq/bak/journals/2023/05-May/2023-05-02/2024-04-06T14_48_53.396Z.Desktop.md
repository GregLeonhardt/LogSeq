- This isn’t good, the viral load actually went up.  So much for going home today or any time soon. Surprisingly, the doctors are not all that concerned that the levels went up.  (The increase wasn’t all that much.)  The operating theory is that the peak viral load occurred sometime late last week and the load is actually on the way down.  They also said that they often will not test again for two weeks because the viral load going up is fairly common.
