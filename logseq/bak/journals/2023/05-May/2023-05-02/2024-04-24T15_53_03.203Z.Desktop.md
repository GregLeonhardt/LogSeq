- Good news, she is starting to eat again.  After almost two weeks of literally not eating anything she is nibbling at food again.  This is good but even better she “MAY” be discharged in a couple of days.  I believe they are trying to figure out how to administer the antiviral drug to treat the CMV.  Currently she is getting it through an IV but there seems to be a problem with the particular drug and home healthcare administering it.   It is also available in pill form but, you guessed it, another problem because she isn’t eating full meals.  Right now I have no clue what is going to happen or even if she will be discharged.  Though the transplant department head said he wants it to happen so there is some degree of optimism.
