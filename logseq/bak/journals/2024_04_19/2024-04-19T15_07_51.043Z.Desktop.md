	- **08:57**  A lot happened overnight
		- She had a bloody nose that took a lot to get stopped.
		- She is *VERY* tired.
		- The nurse said she is reaching for words and finding it difficult to talk.
		- Blood cultures came back showing the same bacteria as last time.  The obvious conclusion is that the central line is the problem and it was removed.
	- **09:53** [[Hepatology]]
		- Concerned that the billyruben is going up and scheduled the ERCP for this afternoon.
