		- Greetings Joyce,
		  
		  I will proceed with the initial consultation process. Please send me a list of all parties 
		  involved so I can run a conflicts check.
		  Will the initial consultation be just you, or will anyone else by joining? Would you like it to be via telephone or Microsoft TEAMS? If teams, audio or video?
		  
		  I will pencil you in for 04/08 at 2pm. Once conflicts are cleared and we receive the initial consultation fee, your appointment will be confirmed.
		  
		  Thanks,
		  Ari

		- Hello Ari,
		  
		  I'm not sure if you need just the names or any additional information, but I will also include the metropolitan area each resides.
		  
		  The names are:
		      Gregory Leonhardt, Denver CO
		      Scott Leonhardt, Chicago IL
		      Ruth Leonhardt, Dallas TX
		      Joyce Anderson, Phoenix AZ
		  
		  I'm sure everyone would like to be present for the meeting, because that ensures we all receive the same message.  I have not heard of Microsoft TEAMS, but that sounds like the best option. I believe we would also prefer the video option.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I think 2 PM on Monday April 8th is ok for all. (Scott, let us know if 4:00 your time is ok or not.)
		  
		  Please let me know if you need any additional information.
		  
		  Joyce Anderson
