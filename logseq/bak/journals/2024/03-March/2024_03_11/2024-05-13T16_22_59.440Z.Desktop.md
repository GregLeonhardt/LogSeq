- Is the Synology box failing.  One of the disk drives was set to read-only mode this morning.  I think it was one of the USB drives used for backup.
- Well I was able to create and save this note so the server is alive.  When I connect in with Putty and attempt to do 'top' or 'htop' the terminal completely locks up.  Can't even terminate the application.  I'm going to attempt a reboot.
- Wish me luck..
