# [[Sandy]]
	- **04:34** Temperature 100.8.
		- I know it's over the new tripwire level but I want to give her every opportunity to stay out of the hospital.
	- **05:02** Temperature 101.3
		- Well that's it. We have to get to the hospital.  Naturally she is doing everything she can to not go but she realizes that is is going to happen.
	- **05:08** I gave her some Tylenol to knock back the temperature.
	- **05:35** We are off to the hospital. [[Hospitalizations]]
	- **06:29** We have been here for about an hour and just now moving from the waiting area to a room.  All-in-all fairly quick.
	- **07:28** Blood samples are all taken and the doctor came by.  Nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the doctors to decide what to do next.
	- **08:24** Good thing we came in when we did. Her blood pressure dropped 81/34 (47) and the first blood test in has her hemoglobin at 5.3.
	- **13:04** Just started the second unit of blood up in ICU (room 8851).  They have run a whole bunch of blood and other tests, CT scan.  So far the only things they found are the low hemoglobin and low magnesium. I haven't heard anything about what is causing the infection.
	- **13:09** [[Endocrinology]]: According the the tests this morning she is hyper thyroid. Previously she was hypo thyroid.  I expect this means something but I don't know what it is.
	- **13:32** [[Infectious Disease]]: He doesn't think it's an infection.  He is looking for a cause for the blood loss.
	- **14:02** [[Hepatology]] No answers as to what is going on.
	- **14:24** [[Infectious Disease]]: Going to restart the antibiotic with something different.
	- **14:53** [[Nephrology]] Nothing to add for a diagnosis.  Concerned that the blood pressure is so low.  [NOTE: It did go up but is dropping again.]
	- **15:34** [[Endocrinology]] They are looking at two tests (T4 Free & TSH).  Normally when one is high the other is low but for Sandy, both are high.  The Dr. is at a loss for how this can be so she is going to have the test re-run.  Also increasing a medication to force the blood vessels to constrict.  This "SHOULD" increase Sandy's blood pressure.

		- The power adapter connection to the laptop is flaking out now and then. Anyway I was wondering if the laptop supports USB charging so I downloaded the reference guide.  From what I can see it does **NOT**.

			- Joyce;
			  
			  I removed Lena from the distribution list.  There should only be one person communicating with her to eliminate mixed messages.  Like it or not, that's you.
			  
			  A couple things I see right off the bat:
			  
			  1) It is a trust account as stated in the address block of the statements.
			  
			  2) This is only good for deposits and withdrawals.  There is no record of where the money was spent, everything is a debit card and no payee information.  Most withdrawals are for $5,000 but there are months with no activity and other months with multiple withdrawals for $10,000.  This could simply be the bank statements didn't align with payments to the facility.  To me it is off that the amount is exactly $5,000.  In April 2018 there were two transfers to a different account.
			- 2a) I would like to see a better accounting of what these transfers were for.
			- 3)
			  There are many missing pages from the document and at least one 
			  duplicate. (I got tired of sorting through the documents that were 
			  included at the end of 2018.)
			- 4) The document only covers from October 2017 through May 2021.  There is no information after May of 2021.

			- I missed a couple of things:
			  
			  The request for documents was made back on July 10, 2023.
			  
			  There is no mention in the letter what time period the request was being made for.

			- I  am missing a lot of stuff here.  My assumption was that this came from the lawyer Joyce is trying to schedule a meeting with.  It came from the  estate (Louise's) lawyer.
