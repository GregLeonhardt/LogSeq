# [[Sandy]]
	- **09:43** Cleanup and change of cloths.
		- I brought in a long sleeve top not thinking that she doesn't have the central line any more and the long sleeve will block access to the IV lines.  If she isn't released today I will bring in a short sleeve top tomorrow.
	- **09:59** [[Infectious Disease]]
		- Stopping by to stop by.  No new information.
	- **10:53** ICU [[Neurology]]
		- Quick physical test, squeeze fingers, push against, etc.
			- PASS
		- No need to do lumbar puncture (LP).
	- **11:02** [[Endocrinology]]
		- Probably going to increase the Insulin dosage based on yesterdays results.
		- I pointed out that documentation has been poor at discharge.
		- Also informed the team that there is at least a possibility of changing the anti-rejection medication.
	- **15:09** [[Hepatology]]
		- No change to the immune suppressant medication she is currently (always been) taking.
			- Their thinking is that it is very unlikely that this was the trigger for the seizure.
				- Sandy is on a very low dose.
				- These medications will usually cause reactions when first used not over one year later.
		- Switching from IV Keppra to pill form once she is discharged.
		- Starting the paperwork for discharge.
	- **15:24** [[Endocrinology]]
		- Changes to insulin schedule:
			- Lantus: 16 units
			- Sliding Scale: 2
			- Carb Ratio: 8:1

		- Greetings Stephen,
		  
		  Thanks so much for your time today.
		  
		  I am writing to summarize our call and request for information.
		  
		  While I understand your client has produced what may be sufficient information by law, my clients want to ensure they are getting the distribution to which they are entitled.
		  
		  To that end, transparency is the key to resolving concerns, even if the law does not require it. Providing the requested information, should establish beyond a doubt that the distribution amount is appropriate.
		  
		  Thus, in the spirit of resolving my clientsâ€™ concerns and facilitating the prompt distribution of their interests, I am requesting:
			- A complete copy of the trust, excluding reference to beneficial interests other than my clients (excluding Richard Wodrich, David Wodrich, Margaret Jane Walters, and William Wodrich).
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- A copy of the Settlement Statement or similar document showing the proceeds from the sale of the Illinois property.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- I appreciate your time today and hope your client chooses to provide the information so we can finalize the distributions.
		  
		  Many thanks,
		  Stacey
