# [[Sandy]]
	- ## [[Endocrinology]]
		- We have a sample Freestyle Libre 3 that Sandy is going to try.
			- Put it on this afternoon and so far no complaints.  "I don't even notice that I have it on."
		- Suggested that in the mornings with no TPN we increase the insulin carb ratio from 12:1 to 11:1.
			- I don't think this will make any difference.
		- She was supposed to give us a code to allow Nebraska Med to see the data but it's after hours and no code.
			- TODO Send in request if we haven't received anything yet.
	- ## Home Nursing
		- We have a scheduling conflict Monday morning.  (Sandy has her IVIG infusion)
			- I sent a text to Cindy and she said that she can be here Tuesday morning.
