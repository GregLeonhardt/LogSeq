# [[The Duke]] [[Landing]
	- What is going on.  We were leaving for an appointment and had a letter stuck in the door.  A seven day notice for nonpayment of rent.  But it was from the apartment complex not Landing.
	- I sent a copy to Landing while waiting for the appointment.
	- Called to get some immediate action when we returned.

- # [[Sandy]] [[Hepatology]]
	- All kinds of good news.
		- No more TPN.
			- We have one bag left and will do it tonight.
		- Sandy was taking Trazodone to help her sleep when in the hospital back in February.
			- When she was released she was sleeping all the time so I asked about stopping it.
				- We stopped.
			- Last Sunday refilling her pill box I noticed it was still on her medication list but forgot about the previous conversation.
			- All the puzzle pieces put back together.  Sandy should not restart taking it and the prescription is to be removed from her medication list.
		- We asked about clearing her appointment schedule so we could take a week or so back home.
			- Nothing is confirmed yet but we **"MAY"** be released to return permanently in three or four weeks.
