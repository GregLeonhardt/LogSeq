# #Sandy
	- Not doing too good this morning.  Blood sugar is above 600 and yes she had her #TPN last night.  But she had all the insulin and it had been keeping it in the 3250 to 300 range.  Anyhow I gave her the maximum 15 units of NovoLog.
	- Worse than that her temperature was 100.0.  She had been running a low grade (98 - 99) on Sunday but it went away Sunday night.  Monday morning she was back to her normal 97.7 and we didn't take it the rest of the day.  #Sandy was up, exercising and all the normal stuff so it looked like the elevated temperature was over.
	- I called the transplant center because her temperature isn't coming down.  They ordered some blood tests and an x-ray so we went in and did it.
	- It's night time and her temperature still isn't coming down.  It has come very close to but hasn't cracked the 101 barrier.  If it were up to me I would take her in but she doesn't want to go.  If it's still high in the morning I will call again to see if I can get a direct admit to bypass the ER.
- # #NoteStation
	- All journal entries from #NoteStation are successfully ported over to #LogSeq.  They are in but not entirely formatted properly.  Maybe at some time in the future I'll go back and finish formatting them but that isn't likely.
- # #LogSeq
	- While porting over the journal entries from #NoteStation I discovered that the Journal directory does not have to be flat.  I created a tree of YYYY/MM/DD and all the entries are seen by the program.
