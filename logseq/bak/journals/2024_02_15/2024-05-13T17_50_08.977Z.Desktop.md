			- Husband is requesting and INR check with next labs, and Dr. Shane was wanting to check a CHF peptide with the next labs as well. Would like to get Sandy in with someone to help wrap her leg up to her thigh.
			- We will see her in clinic in 1 week.
			- Called Cindy RN, Reviewed that we are adding a CHF peptide and INR to next labs. She voiced understanding. Asked if they had a specialist with the HHC who could teach the pt how to wrap her leg up to the thigh with an ace bandage. Cindy reviewed that they do not have that. Also reviewed that we are decreasing her TPN to 4 nights a week.
