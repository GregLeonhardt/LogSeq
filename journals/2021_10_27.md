- I haven’t been sleeping very well the past few nights, last night was pretty bad.  I went to sleep around 10:00 pm and woke up to go to the bathroom around 12:30 am.  Then I woke up again around 1:30 am then again around 2:30 am. I suppose I shouldn’t have eaten those three Kit-Kat bars.  Anyhow from 2:30 on I could only sleep for around 20 minutes every hour. Around 5:30 am I gave up and just got up.
- On the Sandy front things are not going very well.  Still the same problem of water retention.  The Doctor here has finally stated that he is in contact with Doctor Kraft and they have increased the dosage of the water reduction medication (Lasics or something like that) from 40 units to 180 units.  The primary problem here is that this medication is very hard on the kidneys which aren’t working very
  well to start with.
- On that note the Doctor here wanted to put Sandy on a catheter to measure how much she is peeing and Sandy didn’t like that idea at all.  In the end they compromised to so a blater scan before she goes to the bathroom to get a handle on how much is coming out.  So far the numbers are disappointing to say the least.  Nothing above 50 so far when it should be a few hundred.  The Doctor hasn’t said anything yet but I am afraid this is pointing to her kidneys shutting down which means she will be on dialysis very soon.  The last time I even mentioned dialysis she wanted to immediately change the subject so I haven’t brought it up again.
