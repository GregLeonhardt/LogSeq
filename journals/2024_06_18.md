# [[TrueNAS Scale]]
	- I guess that I am stubborn, in the face of it not working I still press on.
	- I started the Virtual Box (VB) machine again this morning and it recovered and was running.  Well it was running to the point where I attempted to install another Docker Container.  Then The entire VB machine froze again.  (This is a plus in that it didn't take the host with it again.)
		- I am thinking that this might have something to do with the internet connection. (I am tethering the internet through my phone.)
		- Alternatively the VB guest OS is out of memory and thrashing (paging in and out without getting any real work done).  I can see the VB guest is running at 100% CPU and memory is at about 100% but there appears to be some swap space available.  I say appears because the terminal and 'htop' are frozen.  All monitoring is being done with host OS tools (Windows).
