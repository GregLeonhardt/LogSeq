	- It is probably because the monitor is giving continuous data but her glucose level isn't moving like I think it should. We have seen a few unexplainable high reading over the past few days.  Now with the monitor we can see the [[insulin]] isn't doing anything.  Sometimes it starts to go down and then almost immediately goes back up.  Time for a professional to evaluate.
