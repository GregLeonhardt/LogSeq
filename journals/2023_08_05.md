	- Ailene:
		- Issue description: As I have previously stated: My medications are going through changes.  It takes too long to order then through your service and they are changing weekly.
	- Ailene:
		- Hello, it is my pleasure to assist you, please allow me a moment to access your account.
	- Sondra L:
		- All my prescriptions are being filled locally (as previously stated you take too long).  Please stop sending me reminders to reorder.  I will setup long term orders and reorders when the time comes.
	- Ailene:
		- Hi, good day! my name is Ailene, I hope you're doing well today.
	- Ailene:
		- Would you like me to update your communication preferences to email?
	- Sondra L:
		- Whatever it takes to stop annoying e-mails asking me to do something you are not capable of doing.
	- Ailene:
		- Thank you for the confirmation. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. I totally understand your frustrations. I will be happy to pass your feedback on to our team so that they can work on this.
	- Sondra L:
		- Thank You.
	- Sondra L:
		- I will be back in touch when my prescriptions settle down and I am able to setup long term refills.
