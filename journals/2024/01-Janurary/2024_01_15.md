			- **Dr. Kistler reviewed patient's carotid duplex and CTA H/N, and informed patient that her left ICA has 50-69% stenosis with less than 50% stenosis in right ICA and antegrade flow in bilateral vertebral arteries.  Dr. Kistler discussed with patient that her symptoms likely not related to carotid artery stenosis and would categorize her as asymptomatic, and recommend continued medical management and monitoring.  Patient was encouraged to try to remain as active as possible and keep blood pressure under good control.  She will avoid smoking.  She will stay on Plavix and atorvastatin, in addition to her Eliquis.  If patient were to develop any stroke-like/TIA symptoms including amaurosis fugax, dysarthria or unilateral extremity weakness she will call 911 or go to the ER immediately.  Plan on patient returning to clinic in 1 year with carotid duplex or sooner as needed.  Both patient and husband agreeable to plan as outlined.  Patient seen in collaboration with Dr. Kistler.
