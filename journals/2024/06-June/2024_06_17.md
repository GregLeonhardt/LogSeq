# [[TrueNAS Scale]]
	- I am having a rethink.  The primary reason for looking at Open Media Vault (OMV) over TrueNAS Scale was that OMV uses BtrFS and TrueNAS Scale uses ZFS.  The initial thinking was that since BtrFS can use mismatched drive sizes I could use a bunch of old drives that were just laying around.  Now I am thinking that the requirement to use the same drive types isn't that big of a deal since I am going to have to buy some new drives anyhow  to achieve the storage capacity I am going to need.
	- So now that I have spent some time running a test system in VirtualBox I am back to saying I can't use it.  The system requirements for TrueNAS are larger than I want to dedicate to a NAS server.  It was consuming enough resources to bring down the host PC.  I guess it is back to running OMV.
