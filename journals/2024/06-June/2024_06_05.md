# [[Sandy]] [[Humana]] [[CenterWell Pharmacy]]
	- I called CenterWell to find out why Sandy's fast acting insulin isn't being covered.  The AI bot than answered the call sent me to the wrong department.
	- Transferred to the a different department and discovered the change of address never went through so we did that.  But this was still the wrong department.  Another transfer.
	- Finally got the correct department and the answer is that Novolog is covered but Aspart (the prescription) is not covered.
	- Sent a message to Nebraska Med to write a new prescription for NovoLog and send it to CenterWell Pharmacy.
	- *While on the WEB site I noticed that the order I put in last Sunday wasn't there.*
		- It isn't waiting for Nebraska Med to approve.
		- It isn't being worked on.
		- It isn't out for delivery.
		- The three medicines that were ordered are no longer on the waiting to be transferred list.
		- ***They are just gone. Vanished into the void of space.***
	- So another call and another connection to the wrong department.  When I finally got to a person in the correct department she wanted nothing to do with assisting me.  She just wanted to pass me on to someone else. ?Quitting time?
		- By now I was done with CenterWell and anything else they could possibly do wrong.  After around three hours on the phone with them almost nothing was accomplished.  I disconnected the call and will be taking the prescriptions to Walgreens tomorrow.
