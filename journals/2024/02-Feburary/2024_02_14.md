		- **PLAN:**
			- Patient did not develop any hoarseness after the parathyroidectomy in late 12/2023, so I think that this is not related to the parathyroidectomy. Additionally, while intubation can cause vocal fold immobility, her configuration of vocal folds looking more like a palsy, is not suggestive of a cricoarytenoid joint link dislocation. This may be idiopathic, but a vagal nerve lesion needs to be ruled out. I would recommend a CT of the neck with contrast even though she had one done in preparation for a parathyroidectomy, which was well before she developed hoarseness. She was not very "gaggy", and I think would probably be a good candidate for an awake vocal cord injection. She is very frustrated. I would favor using calcium hydroxyapatite despite its difficulty to inject. Finally, she does have dysphagia, but it is quite mild, so I don ot think she absolutely needs a modified barium swallow. I suspect it may improve with vocal cord injection. Also I will get an opinion from one of my colleagues regarding the nasopharyngeal lesion and whether it requires a biopsy.
