		- Xfinity Assistant (10:04 pm): Hi, it's Xfinity Assistant.Thanks for contacting us today. We've opened case number ECM0006777196 regarding your Seasonal Convenience Plan for 5670 W 118TH AVE. You'll hear from us with a status update in the next 48 hours.TxtHelpOrStopMsg&amp;DataRatesMayApply
	- At the end of the second online chat I was supposed to and did receive a telephone call from another representative.  Like all other conversations it started with promises that my problem would be fixed.  Here are a few takeaways I had from the conversation:
		- He wanted to update my contact information;
			- This was a waist of out time as the contact information was up to date and he was talking to me on the phone number in the contact information.  This obviously has nothing to do with the billing issue I am talkiing to him about.
		- He also wanted me to go online to change the seasonal service start date.
			- Another obvious waist of our time.  Why would Xfinity allow customers to retroactively change service dates.
		- He wanted to know if there was anybody at the house that could verify the service was still working:
			- Yet another obvious no there isn't.  If there was I wouldn't have activated the seasonal service and we wouldn't have been having the conversation about the start date.
		- He apparently attempted to change the start date to January 5th and waited and waited and waited for his system to update.  Eventually he gave up and attempted to loop someone else into the conversation.  After something like 15 minutes this was done and I was talking to someone else again.
			- This person finally decided that the reason they couldn't correct the start date is that the bill is overdue.  I explained to him that the bill is overdue is because it is wrong and it would be paid immediately once it was corrected.
		- We went back and forth with this and that and I finally ended it by asking him to terminate the account.
	- I thought the account was closed but a few hours later I get a text saying they are still working the ticket.

	- Still having problems with the charger.  And they are getting worse.  I think the charger was glitching on and off and it glitched the laptop.  It wouldn't turn on anymore.
	- After taking it apart, pulling the battery for a while and plugging it back in it turned on again.
	- So it's back working again but needless to say I need a new charger.
