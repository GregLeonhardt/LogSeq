# [[Sandy]]
	- **09:00** Last night recap:
		- [[Glucose]] levels were off the charts {literally}.  Blood tests showed it in the 700 to 800 range. [[Endocrinology]] thought the amount of NPH was too high so they cut it in half.  Surprise, surprise, it wasn't enough.
			- To get a handle on the [[Glucose]] level they put [[Sandy]] on an insulin drip.
		- Stopping most if not all medication to raise her blood pressure.  Currently it is stable and good with the possibility that it is too high.  I suspect that when the medication raews off it will return to a normal (for Sandy) level.
	- **09:15** [[Infectious Disease]]:   They did find a bug in her blood stream that fits the puzzle pieces for symptoms.  Medication is being adjusted to fit the bug.
	- **11:40** [[Nephrology]]: Very pleased with the change from yesterday to today.
		- Asked about low [[magnesium]]:
			- The [[tacrolimus]] will drive the [[magnesium]] levels down.
			- When the [[Nephrology]] is working it will remove [[magnesium]] from the body.
			- Anything above 1.3 is a good number for a transplant patient taking [[tacrolimus]].
	- **11:57** [[Endocrinology]] Going to keep the IV [[insulin]] drip until at least tomorrow to cover the [[TPN]] tonight.
		- The high readings are a result of the [[TPN]] and [[steroids]] for low blood pressure.
		- Going to increase the amount of [[NPH]] with her [[TPN]] tonight to in an attempt of reducing the degree of high sugar tonight.
