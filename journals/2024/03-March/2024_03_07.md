Well, though we didn't have firm plans on when to return to Colorado, the weather made the decision for us.  It looks like a lot of snow is moving in on Friday so we are heading back today.
And a good thing we did.  We hit a few flurries here and there but the closer we got to Nebraska the worse it got.  The last few miles of I76 were closed but it was all clear once we got to I80.
A big fail on the front end noise in the Camry.
