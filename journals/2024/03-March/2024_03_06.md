Nick stopped by again and we did an oil change on the Toyota.  Nick found what might actually be the noise in the front of the car.  The plastic inner fender pulled loose from it's mounting bolt.  Well see if that was it on the way back to Omaha.

		- Greetings Joyce,
		  
		  Conflicts are clear!  I will be sending you an invoice for the initial consultation payment. Once payment is received, I will issue a TEAMS link for a video meeting on the 8th to all parties on this email thread.
		  Please let me know 
		  if you have any questions and feel free to send any documents youâ€™d like
		  for Stacey to have for the meeting. I have the two you previously sent 
		  along with the email thread.
