# [[TPN]]
	- Woke up this morning to a loud screeching sound.  It wasn't hard to trace the source, the TPN pump was alarming because the battery was dead.  The set of batteries in it were in it when it came as a replacement for the broken pump and on night two.  The power level was typical for the second night of use but obviously wasn't.  Anyhow, after replacing the batteries the pump was restarted and should run to completion.
	- The question now is do I switch the batteries every night or continue using them for two nights.

	- It is time to get this running on the [[Ryzen-9]] desktop.
		- Because I am primarily using Windows on this system I am running this in a [[VirtualBox OS Install]] container.
		- Stuff I need to install:
			- DONE [[Bitcoin]]
				- Installed, running, and up to date.
			- DONE [[OpenJDK]]
			- DONE [[NetBeans]]
			- DONE [[MariaDB]]
			- DONE [[libbitcoin-explorer]]
				- I still can't compile but I downloaded a binary from the Internet Archive WayBack machine.  This will have to do for now.
