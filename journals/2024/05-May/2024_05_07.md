	- I believe I just found the last nail for the coffin. The WEB interface does *NOT* support any of the advances features for BTRFS.  I suppose I could setup cron jons for scrub and snapshot but that also means that I will have to manually manage deleting the old snapshots.  Also, what is the interface for using a snapshot to recover data?  This is all a bit more than I am prepared to work through.  I'm out.
