# A [[New Home NAS]]

		- Not so quick there..
		- I found two highly rated programs that can manage taking snapshots:
			- 1) [[snapper]]
			  2) [[timeshift]]
		- Of the two, 'snapper' looks to be the most robust.  This is the one I will attempt to implement.
		- Well..  It looks like snapper will fill the role of managing snapshot copy.  I have already resigned myself to managing BtrFS manually.  What else is there ?
