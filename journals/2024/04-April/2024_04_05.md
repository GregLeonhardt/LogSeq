# [[block_scan]]
	- I modified the count tool to use the 'official' log file ``crontab -e``
		- ``0  */1  *   *   *    echo "`/usr/bin/date "+\%D \%T"` | `/usr/bin/cat ~/.LibTools/BlockScan.* |  /usr/bin/grep --count ADDRESS`"  >> /home/greg/Database/count``
	- [[logrotate]]
		- It is still a work-in-progress but here is what I have so far:
			- ```
			  /home/greg/.LibTools/BlockScan.log {
			  	notifempty
			  	missingok
			  	rotate	-1
			  	size	100M
			  	create
			  }
			  
			  ```
			- Rotate when the file is larger than 100 MB for an unlimited number of times and create a new empty file when rotation has completed.
- # [[Open Media Vault]]
	- Now that Comcast/Xfinity are no more I don't have an ability to synchronize files between computers.
	- I believe that Open Media Vault has this capabilities but I need to confirm it.
	- DONE What is it going to take to run OMV in Omaha?
