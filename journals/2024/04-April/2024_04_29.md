# [[Sandy]]
	- **09:43** Cleanup and change of cloths.
		- I brought in a long sleeve top not thinking that she doesn't have the central line any more and the long sleeve will block access to the IV lines.  If she isn't released today I will bring in a short sleeve top tomorrow.
	- **09:59** [[Infectious Disease]]
		- Stopping by to stop by.  No new information.
	- **10:53** ICU [[Neurology]]
		- Quick physical test, squeeze fingers, push against, etc.
			- PASS
		- No need to do lumbar puncture (LP).
	- **11:02** [[Endocrinology]]
		- Probably going to increase the Insulin dosage based on yesterdays results.
		- I pointed out that documentation has been poor at discharge.
		- Also informed the team that there is at least a possibility of changing the anti-rejection medication.
	- **15:09** [[Hepatology]]
		- No change to the immune suppressant medication she is currently (always been) taking.
			- Their thinking is that it is very unlikely that this was the trigger for the seizure.
				- Sandy is on a very low dose.
				- These medications will usually cause reactions when first used not over one year later.
		- Switching from IV Keppra to pill form once she is discharged.
		- Starting the paperwork for discharge.
	- **15:24** [[Endocrinology]]
		- Changes to insulin schedule:
