	- [[Endocrinology]]
		- Her blood sugars have been on the high side but this afternoon they are off the charts, literally.  She had a sandwich and egg roll at the hospital cafeteria.  Since then the glucose level has been a straight upward.  from 12:30 40 3:30 it went from 214 to over 500.  8 units of insulin for the food and  sliding scale,  another 4 at 2:00 because it was still going straight up and almost 300, another 10 when it went over 5029.  At 3:00 we thought it had stopped going up but later found out that the meter tops out at 350.
		- **15:56**  It has started going down and to 488.  Not a huge change but it is finally stopped going up.
		- **17:25** *349*
		- **19:00** *300* The continuous monitor is reading again.  We ate dinner.  Almost carb free but gave her eight (8) units for sliding scale.
