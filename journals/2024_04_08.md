- # [[GitHub]]
	- Well, Yes it was a disaster but I can't find anything else to do a backup.  Here is the current configuration.
		- Data is being stored on 'G-Drive'
			- This allows any number of computers to simultaneously access and modify the data.
				- NOTE: If multiple computers modify the same file at the same time, the last saved is the only copy.  Changes from other computers WILL BE LOST.
		- GitHub is turned back on.
			- ONLY ON THE LAPTOP.
				- This way there is only one computer managing the GitHub push and pull so there shouldn't be a synchronization problem.
