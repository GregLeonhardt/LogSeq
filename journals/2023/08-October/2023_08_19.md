	- For I think the first time, the weight is stable.
	- Well, Last night went remarkably well.  The BiPAT mask was on most, if not all, night.  I can see she is better.  Not grasping for words or slurred speech.  Still on the tired side but I expect that is to be expected.  And, though only nibbling, she is starting to eat.
	- It is just a little possible that I overreacted earlier.  Sandy had the BiPAT mask off from about 9 am to 12 pm.  I keep prompting her to start to eat something but all she wants is coffee.  Yesterday she said she would give up the coffee and eat at least try to eat something today.  Today it was back to coffee and about threw a fit when I didn't jump up and go get it.  I was pissed, went and got her coffee and left.
