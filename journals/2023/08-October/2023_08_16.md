80.2 Kg. 176.44 Lb. [- 8.14]
	- The first thing out of her mouth this morning was "I guess it didn't work."  She got it in her head that the TIPS was going to be an instant fix and she would be up and walking around without any assistance of any type.
	- I guess they used the low reading scale today.  The paracentesis  only removed about 2.2 pounds so where did the other six (6) pounds go?
	- Still not eating anything.  I am hoping that the sleeping/tiredness is the reason.
	- She is VERY tired again.  I suppose some of it could be carry-over from the surgery yesterday. it just seems excessive.  She is also taking VERY shallow breaths and it is hard for her to speak.  I expect the extreme shallow breaths is the problem with speaking.
