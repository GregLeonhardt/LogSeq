	- The first of what I should have started months ago. There is a lot to catch up on so I'll do my best to fill in the blanks as needed.
	- Sandy has been in the hospital for almost three weeks now. She is NPO for a procedure later today, actually two procedures. She is continuously retaining fluid so the first will be a #paracentesis and the other is something called a portal pressure. Essentially it is measuring the blood pressure between the liver and ???. It is being done to try to understand why she is suddenly retaining fluids and requiring the paracentesis.
	- Overall she is in good spirits today and actually had some real food. Only a little fruit and half of a 6" Subway but that is more than she has eaten in the past couple of weeks combine.
	- Well as with everything else, plans change. They added a CT scan before the scheduled procedures. The CT scan showed some clotting in the lungs so the other two procedures were cancelled. To resolve the clotting they are starting Sandy on heparin IV. So, along with the heparin they need to do frequent blood draws to dial in the heparin IV rate and naturally even though she already has has a midline, it isn't working to draw blood and they will be sticking her for the blood draws.
