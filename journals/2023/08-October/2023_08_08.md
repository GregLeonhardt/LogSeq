	- Sometime last night they added another midline and this time it is working for blood draws.
	- The two procedures that were cancelled yesterday are back on the schedule today. While Sandy is NPO again they are completing the tube feed.
- # Docker Status
	- It looks like the home server is mostly locked up. I was initially going to write all this stuff there but I was not able to login to any of the docker containers. I was trying this and that believing the hospital WIFI was blocking me then I get a text from Ruth saying she is not able to login. Well, this is a problem. If I can't connect I can't even look to see what is wrong. I know the server is running because it is doing the CrashPlan backups and they are still running.
	- I messaged Nick. He will go over on Thursday to reboot the server.
