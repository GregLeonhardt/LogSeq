	- I am guessing they are alternating scales and the one used this morning is the one that weighs a little heaver.
	- Well I was extra cautious coming into the room this morning because I expected Sandy would have been moved to the Step Down unit and started the BiPAT. Then I was surprised to find her still here. Extra and more intensive breathing treatments were ordered some time after I left yesterday and my first impression is that they are working though it is still too early to have an opinion.
	- Just about everybody has been by and it has been a busy morning.  She got up out of bed and went for a walk with PT.  She said that she went about as far as she did before the TIPS procedure.  Much better than barely being able to make it to the bathroom yesterday.
	- There is a new bacterial infection.  VanA/B and Enterococcus faecium.  The bacteria is something that most people carry in their intestines'.  That leaves the question of how did it get out.  Their operating theory is that it may have been released during the TIPS procedure.  I an thinking outside the box and it came from when she barfed up the bile on Monday.  One way or the other I suppose the important thing is that it was caught and is being treated.
