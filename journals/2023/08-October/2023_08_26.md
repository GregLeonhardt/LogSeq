	- Now that Sandy believes she is going to rehab unless she gets stronger she is doing everything she is asked to do. Sitting in the chair, going for walks, etc. Though she needs to be doing the breathing machine more frequently.
	- There bathroom tripod and one (short) walk @3:00pm.
	- Not eating. It's a chore to get her to eat a cookie. Still in love with Starbucks. I hate that she wants them. I just keep telling myself that it's more than water or Sprite going past her lips.

	- I was up a couple of times last night but getting back to sleep wasn't a problem. Finally got up around seven but probably could have gone back to sleep again.
	- For the first time I forgot no back pack so I am forced to do this on the phone.
