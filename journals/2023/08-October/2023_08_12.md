# [[Sandy]] 
80.2 Kg. 176.44 Lb. [+ 5.06]
	- Her weight makes absolutely no sense.  Again she gained five pounds after having another paracentesis yesterday where they removed 2.? liters [that is around 4.5 pounds.]  That means she actually gained over nine (9) pounds yesterday.  I just don't know how this is possible.
	- There is also a problem with the tube feedings.  According the the records it was started at 9:30 pm yesterday and discontinued at 1:00 pm today.  So it ran for 15 1/2 hours at 90 ml/hour.  So doing the math 15.5 * 90 = 1,395 ml. should have been delivered between start and finish.  The problem is that a new 1,000 ml. bag was hung yesterday and there was still 100 ml. in the bag when it was done.  Bottom line Sandy is only getting 2/3 the nutrition they think she is getting.
	- She has been tired but today is over the top, basically sleeping all day.  Not a deep sleep but sleeping.  It doesn't take much more than the hospital room door opening for her to open her eyes. Her temperature etc. are all normal but I think she is getting sick again.  Tired, out of breath just going to the bathroom, and that clear gelatinous liquid running from her nose.
	- I was going to take her for a walk but I doubt that she will get very far.
