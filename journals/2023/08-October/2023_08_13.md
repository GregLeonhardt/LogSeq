	- Just a touch better than yesterday.  She will go to sleep if undisturbed for more than five minutes but a very shallow and alert sleep.  Any noise (other than the TV) will wake her.
	- Up to the bathroom half a dozen times while I was there and who knows when I'm not.
	- We went for two walks today.  They were not very long but Sandy wad up and out of the bed walking.  [Anything is better than nothing.]
	- Sane thing with the feeding tube as yesterday where the numbers simply do not add up. I brought this to the attention of the doctors on rounds to get their impression.  They said it was a conversation for tomorrow when the nutritionist would be here.
	- I also had a thought that the ascites and feeding tube started about the same time so I did a quick Google search.  The results were enlightening though targeted to people with liver cirrhosis.  Generally the articles were saying the use resulted in longer hospital stays.  I have to wonder if the feeding tube was a cause or effect of the poor outcomes.  [Another conversation for the team tomorrow.]
