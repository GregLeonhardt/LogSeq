	- Released from step down to SOTU.  More good things to come.
	- So far a very down day.  She is very tired and will revert to head nods instead of answering questions.  A little while ago she started shaking and (to me) felt like she had temperature.  The nurse aid came in and her temperature was normal.  Eventually the nurse came in and she thinks it is related to the breathing treatment.  Whatever it was after a warm blanket it appears to have subsided.
	- On a positive note, Dr. Langnas is starting the talks for when she will be released.  No dates proposed yet just talks on what needs to be done before release.  Change feeding from continuous to intermittent with a new insulin regiment. Continue to work on breathing.
	- Doesn't even want to put on cloths.  Prefers the hospital gown.

	- I chastised Noah this morning for not calling Sandy like he said he would.  He replied saying he has been sick.
		- 1) he wasn't sick when he said he would call.
		- 2) He was able to reply to my text but not able to send Sandy a message.  I am so disappointed.
