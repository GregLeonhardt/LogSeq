77.8 Kg. 171.16 Lb. [ 0.0] Standing Weight
	- The weight is a bit excessive even considering she isn't getting water pills.
	- The real discussion for hospital release has started.  Probably Friday or Monday, transfer to rehab.
	- For the first time in a very long time she is cold.  Wrapped up in blankets but still cold.  The telltale sign of a runny nose isn't there so fingers crossed that it will pass on it's own.
	- The nose started to run, she felt VERY cold, heart rate went into the 110's, blood pressure went to 159/79, threw up and a new set of blood etc. tests are ordered.
