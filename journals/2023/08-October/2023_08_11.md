# [[Sandy]] 
77.9 Kg 171.38 Lb. [- 7.92]
	- The weight yesterday is not to be believed unless somehow she gained almost 20 pounds between Wednesday and Thursday and then went on to loose bout 6 pounds yesterday.  I think they must be using bed weight every now and then but Sandy consistently says that she gets up to stand on the scale.  I don't know but I just can't believe her weight is changing that much that fast.
	- Sandy had a liver biopsy this morning.  [Results will not be available until the middle of next week.]  As long as she was already in IR (interventional radiology) they went ahead and did another paracentesis.  [Another 2.1? liters.]
	- Someone screwed up last night.  Sandy's tube feeding is all out of whack because the procedures keep getting postponed.  Well the tube feeding was stopped at midnight for the NPO order but the order to stop insulin didn't get stopped.  Sandy had some very low blood sugar levels last night and this morning.  Eventually they figured out what happened and hung a glucose bag to compensate for the extra insulin.
	- The heparin for the lung clotting is a long term thing, maybe up to three months but will transition to pills once she is released.
	- Just one rather short walk today but after all she did have a biopsy earlier.
	- I expect it was because the tube feeding stopped at midnight.  She ate half an English muffin with cream cheese, a bowl of tomato soup, and a package of Lorna Doone cookies.
