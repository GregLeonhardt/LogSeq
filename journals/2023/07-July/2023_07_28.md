		- Well another day another treatment plan.
		- It was the cardio team that was thinking infection. I guess the liver team overrode them and now it's the high heart rate and low lung volume that is the problem. (I have to add that I've been complaining (bringing to their attention) about this for more than two weeks.)
		- Anyhow they gave her some medicine that will lower the heart rate and it's down from a sustained 115 to around 90. Also working on breathing to increase lung volume.
		- These two things are supposed to get the excess fluid to move from tissue to the blood stream (it has been moving in the other direction) where the kidney can do its thing.
		- Expectations are that she will remain in ICU until at least Monday then return to the transplant floor.
