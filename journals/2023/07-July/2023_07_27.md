		- I got a call at 3:30 this morning from Sandy. She is still tired but can at least answer basic questions.
		- A lot of fluid in the stomach area is making her uncomfortable. I expect another tap is coming soon.
		- The team is puzzled by why she is losing fluid from the blood stream. They have a few possibilities but none that are a good fit to everything else going on.
		- I learned that what I have been calling a CPAT is really a BiPAT machine.
		- They have her off the BiPAT when she is awake and on BiPAT when she sleeps.

		- Another paracentesis (draining excess fluid from the belly) this afternoon. They removed 6.6 liters Monday and 4.4 liters today.
		- To get an idea how much that is, try to imagine drinking five two litter bottles of soda. Then go back and drink another half bottle. To put it in another measurement, that's over 24 pounds of fluid this week and the week isn't over yet.
		- Anyhow, the operating theory is that the excess fluid is a result of an infection. The only problem is they can't identify the cause of the infection. They are basing the infection theory on her reoccurring low grade temperature.
