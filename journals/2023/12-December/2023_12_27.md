		- There is finally a direction to move in. After 50 or 75 tests they have decided that the thyroid is overproducing.
		- Don't ask how this can be since up until now it has been underpricing. That is a subject for another day. The focus here and now is forward looking to come up with a treatment plan to compensate.
		- She had been sedated since yesterday afternoon. However even with sedation she started to wake up. When she did I could see that she was more aware than she was yesterday without sedation.Â  Later the nurse reduced the flow of drugs to do "an are you there" check. And she was. When the nurse asked her to squeeze hand and wiggle toes, she did. (A very good sign.)
		- Overall she is still in bad shape but getting better. She will be in ICU at least until the weekend and it's anybody's guess after that.
