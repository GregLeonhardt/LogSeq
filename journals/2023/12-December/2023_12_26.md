# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- **07:41**
		- Not much had changed this morning.
		- She is somewhere between sleep and almost asleep. Not responsive to virtual commands.
		- Running a temperature.
	- **15:22**
		- Tasks completed today (so far):
			- A) Screening for bacteria
			  B) Screening for fungus's
			  C) Ultrasound of parathyroid surgery
			  D) Chest X-Ray
			  E) CT scan
			  F) MRI scan
			  G) EEG
			  H) ECG
		- She had been seen by:
			- A) Liver
			  B) Infectious Disease
			  C) Oncology (parathyroid)
			  D) Neurology
			  E) Cardiology
			  F) Respiratory
		- All that and they still don't even have a direction to go in.Â  That's a bit harsh. They are moving in the direction of some sort of infection but nothing has come back positive on any of the above tests.
		- Good thing #1) They did start broad spectrum antibiotics and her temperature is coming down.
		- Good thing #2) She is starting to show signs of walking up. At first any question was answered with "yes" or "OK" even if the questions contradicted each other. Before I left she added "no" and the answer followed the question.
		- Hopefully that's it for today.
		- I almost forgot. They moved her to ICU. I think mainly because the staff there is better equipped to handle someone that can't follow simple directions or take medicine orally.
