		- Guess where we get to spend Christmas Day?
			- A) Home in Colorado?
			  B) At the apartment in Omaha?
			  C) A private room @ Nebraska Medicine.
		- A clue, it's not A or B.
		- She had a low grade fever (below 100) all day Saturday. Then Sunday morning it was over 101 and I dragged her in where her temperature immediately dropped. But it went up last night and dropped again.
		  Overall she says she is tired and doesn't want to eat.
		  Sorry for the lack of details but that is all there is. Speciation ranges from some sort of undetected infection to a reaction to the surgery last Wednesday.

		- She just had another "seizure like" thing. I think half of the hospital doctors were here and nobody has a clue what is going on.
		- Whatever it was it's over and she is sleeping.
