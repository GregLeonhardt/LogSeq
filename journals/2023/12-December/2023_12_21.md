# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- **14:50**
		- I wasn't here last night when whatever happened but the description was the same as the previous last two hospital visits.
		- When I got here this morning she was back to the old Sandy.
		- There are a bunch of very smart doctors scratching their heads.
		- The surgeon is pleased with her progress (excluding whatever happened last night) and she is expected to be discharged tomorrow.
