	- Two days in a row that Sandy is not only out of the room, she is out for pleasure.  Ani took Sandy down to Starbucks today.
	- PT was here early.  At first Sandy didn't want to do anything, "I just want to rest for 30 minutes".  When reminded that the Starbucks trip was coming up and that PT was probably going to be here twice today, she conceded.  She actually did quite well by getting up from the bed when it was not raised very high.  Still gets winded but she did everything asked of her.
	- When Infectious Disease (ID) came by, they mentioned that the amount of fluid in Sandy's lungs has gone down.  I suspect this is partially from lasics and partially from increased moving around.
