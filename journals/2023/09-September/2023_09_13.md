	- The procedure yesterday went as good as possible.  There was a "big" stone that was broken up and removed.  After a little cleanup a stent was inserted to keep the passage open that will remain in place for several weeks.
	- Starting to talk about the transfers to Madonna again.  My sense is that they want to wait a day or two before the transfer just to make sure no infections come from the procedure.  They are also working on what to do about the CMV anti viral medicine.  Madonna wont accept her with the stuff she is getting now and the alternative stuff is VERY expensive.  Possibly Friday maybe early next week.
