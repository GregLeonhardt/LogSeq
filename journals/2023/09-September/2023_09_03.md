79.5 Kg. 174.9 Lb. [-2.42] Bed Weight
	- I decided to use the bed weight even if there is a standing weight.  This way I know the weight is always coming from the same place.  I try to zero out the scale when she is up for a bathroom break then take the weight as soon as she lays down.  The scale probably isn't accurate, It is way different than what they are getting for a standing weight, but it should be consistently
	- inaccurate.
	- A slow day.  They are giving her lasics again and it's a bathroom break every 30 minutes for a couple of hours.  Six times while I was there.
	- She is still overly tired and will fall asleep whenever the room is quiet for more than five minutes.  But, it's {usually} a shallow sleep and she will wake up if the door opens.
