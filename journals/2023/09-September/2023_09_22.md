# [[Sandy]]
	- A busy day:
	  OT 7:00 am (Shower)
	  PT 9:00am evaluation
	  OT 11:00am evaluation
	  PT 1:30pm evaluation
	- She came back from the last [[PT]] session with the back of her shirt wet.  They must have really worked her.
	- I continue to be impressed with the facility and staff.  The doctor was in again going over possible changes to medication.  Specifically insulin.
	- The plan is that she will have at least one session over the weekend then three sessions on week days.  Like me their predictions are for a short stay.
