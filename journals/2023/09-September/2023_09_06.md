	- An interesting video on SciShow last night.  Ozempic and Wegovy (the same drug in different strengths) is used for chronic weight management. I am not sure, I need to verify, but I think Sandy is taking Ozempic.  If so could this be causing at least some of the "I'm not hungry" problem?
	- Ani took Sandy outside to the patio today. First time outside since she has been in the hospital.
	- (It's Tuesday morning [09/05]) I believe this is the dat Sandy got her IVIG. It could have been yesterday, or even the day before, but it was around here.
