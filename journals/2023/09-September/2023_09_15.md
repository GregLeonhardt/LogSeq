	- So I have discovered one of the reasons I am seeing a big difference between Bed Weight and Standing Weight.  Sandy is receiving medicine to make her pee a lot.  She gets it in the morning just before I arrive or soon after I arrive.  As the day goes by and she takes more and more trips to the bathroom her weight goes down and down.  So the later in the day I measure the larger the difference between bed weight and standing weight.  I didn't look at the scale until later today (then a few more times).  Anyhow I'll have to get the weight at a consistent time for it to be of any use.
	- Yesterday her liver numbers went in the wrong direction [a lot].  To the point where they scheduled another procedure to clean out the bial duct again.  Today the numbers came back down [somewhat].  The operating theory is that there is another stone or something that is near the duct where it will obstruct it then move away.  Anyhow they scheduled a repeat of the same procedure they did on Tuesday to do some more cleaning.
