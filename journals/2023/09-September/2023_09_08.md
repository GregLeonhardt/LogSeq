76.7 Kg. 168.74 Lb. [+5.94] Bed Weight
	- I am starting to question the validity of bed weight even when the bed is zeroed out every day.
	- No field trips today but she is getting around pretty well.  Still gets tired after only very little effort but..
	- The lecture of the week is "she needs to eat more".  Nurse Ani came up with a couple things that can be added to Sandy's water (which she drinks a lot of) to increase protein intake.
	- I got her cafeteria pizza and she only ate a couple of bites.  Says she isn't hungry.  Doctor says "It is your job to eat".
