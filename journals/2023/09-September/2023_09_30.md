# [[Sandy]]
	- I called the transplant coordinator because there does not seam to be a plan to treat the CMV other than waiting for approval for the maintenance drug.  Robin said that she would get with the hepatologist on call to coordinate the next step.
	- It wasn't too long when she called back to say the safest treatment would be to direct admit Sandy back to the hospital.  Naturally this didn't go well with Sandy.
	- Later in the afternoon, after I packed everything up, Robin called back to say that the plans had changed.  She will be staying here at Madonna and they would be giving her the oral form of the medication.  [Madonna said before Sandy came here that they would not be able to give her the IV form because of all the precautions necessary for it's use.]
	- P.S.
	- Sandy was tired and sleepy yesterday but everybody just attributed it to the PT and OT she had been getting.  Now today she should have recovered she is still very tired, probably even more that yesterday.
