		- The only word that comes to mind is "melancholy".
		- She doesn't smile, crack jokes, answer phone calls, look at text messages, or even look at stuff online (shopping).
		- The best analogy is when you're sick with the flu. You just don't want to do anything.Â  They got her temperature down pretty quick with Tylenol but the virus load is very high. One of the doctors said it's the highest viral load she has ever seen. Anyhow they started an anti viral medication but it is expected to take a couple weeks to bring it down and longer to get rid of.
		- Back to the opening comment, all the doctors say all of her external symptoms (not eating, dealing miserable, not enjoying anything) are all typical. And that's the only thing keeping me from completely freaking out. They will stop by for their daily visit and they start saying how this is all typical before I have a chance to point stuff out.
		- Anyhow that's the state of things. If I don't post an update it's because nothing has significantly changed.
