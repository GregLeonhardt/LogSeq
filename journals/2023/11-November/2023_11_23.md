- Well, the web server has been down for a while but I am still way behind in posting.
- We are home (Colorado) for a couple days, see the kids and get Sandy a change of scenery.  We have to be back in Omaha next week Monday but so far it has been a very good trip.
- Recap:
	- Sandy has been doing better week to week.  When she started TPN she wasn't eating much of anything and getting TPN seven nights a week.  Now she is eating very well and her TPN is down to three nights a week.
	- Monday this week was  bad.  Early morning she had convulsion like symptoms, passed out and went
	- into the hospital for observation.  She scared me real bad.  For a few seconds, I actually thought she was dean.  Eyes rolled back in her head and completely stopped moving after shaking violently.  Then after only a few seconds she took a breath of air and after about an hour she was back.  We were supposed to be leaving for Colorado but wound up in the hospital so the doctors could figure out what happened.  In the end they couldn't come up with an understanding of what happened.
