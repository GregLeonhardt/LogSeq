		- They kept her here overnight because her symptoms looked like a couple other scary things.
		- They have ruled out most. Possible release today but I'm thinking more likely tomorrow.
		- Then there is the question of: Will they let her go to Colorado once released?
		- It isn't looking good for Thanksgiving, but not ruled out yet.

		- We just got word that Mom is being released tonight. If I can get some sleep we will be on the road tomorrow morning.
		- Nick, Jason: workout whenever we should be at Jason's so Nick can pick us up Thursday morning.
