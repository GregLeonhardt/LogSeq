		- There was an oops this morning and Mom is back in the hospital.Â  I seriously think they are being over cautious. Then again it's Mom so it's what they should do.
		- Currently we are in the ER but they are already expecting to keep her overnight overnight.

		- Until I am told differently, the trigger was EXTREMELY high blood sugar. That was corrected before we came to the hospital and Mom started getting better almost immediately.
		- If it's possible to be there for Thanksgiving we will be there. If not, we'll be back when we can.
