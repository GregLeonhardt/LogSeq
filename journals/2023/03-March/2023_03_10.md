	- Update on everything we know.
		- o There is a donor.
		  o The donor is brain dead.
		  o They are prepping mom with extra/early dialysis.
	- Just a few of the things we don't know.
		- o Where the donor is?
		  o Is the donor on life support?
		  o Will there be a time where the organs become unusable?
	- I would like to be able to say that tomorrow morning we will be going to the hospital and get things moving but I can't. I can't even say for sure it is going to happen at all. We are doing everything we can. Mainly just waiting for a call from someone to tell us what to do next.
	- Well update you all when there is more information.
