# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- **08:58**
		- We are checking into the hospital.
		- Currently scheduled surgery time is 4:00 am tomorrow morning.
	- **09:09**
		- Minimum two weeks in hospital and for weeks out patient.
		- Expectations are that those times are on the low side
	- **15:21**
		- As you know we are in Omaha waiting for a transplant. We got the call this morning to come to the hospital for surgery early tomorrow morning.
		  The only information we have is that the donor is brain dead and they are removing life support tomorrow.
		- I am in the process of building a text messaging group so I only have to post updates to one place. You should see something "soon".
	- **15:41**
		- Rather than repeating myself over and over and over I created a list with everybody.
		- As of the latest update Sandy will start surgery prep somewhere around 7:30 tomorrow morning. The surgery is expected to take from 6 to 12 hours for the liver. Then she will go back Monday for the kidney. Another 2 to 4 hour surgery.
		- I guess the reason she was brought in early, was too slow the pace of everything. This way the blood draws (15 vials), chest x-ray, etc. are all done.
