# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- Progress towards going home to Colorado had slowed. Her appetite has been poor to nonexistent since the transplant.
	- They tell me this is common even though I amÂ  an extreme case. Last week it got to the point where they put her back in the hospital with a feeding tube. All the doctors keep saying that this is not unusual.
	- She has been extra tired & weak the last couple days and today I am running a fever. So much for being released tomorrow.
	- She haven't had the energy to answer the phone or reply to text messages but I will soon.
