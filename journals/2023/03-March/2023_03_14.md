# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- **13:59**
		- I anticipate this will be my final update. Sandy is doing way better than anybody anticipated. She had been up walking the halls (with supervisory assistance) and had been cleared to exit ICU.
		- She has her phone and is accepting calls.
		- WARNING: There are doctors and nurses coming in and out continuously. She may not answer if someone is in the room. If she answers she may need to hang up in the middle of your conversation. Be patient and try again later.
