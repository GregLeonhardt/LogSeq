# [[Sandy Omaha]]
	- Doctors finally identified what is causing Sandy's fever. It's a virus (I forgot the specific flavor) but related to a herpes virus. The belief is that it was laying dormant in the liver and/or kidney. This virus will lay dormant for years then pop up again. Think cold sore.
	- The doctors are comparing notes on the best way to treat it. For you or me it's fairly straight forward. For a transplant patient, not so much. They basically need to increase her 'T' cell immunization which will increase the possibility of rejection. Expectations are that she will receive some kind of antiviral medication tonight or tomorrow.
	- This has nothing to do with her immune deficiency which deals with 'B' cells not 'T' cells.
	- In another corner, the virus is likely a contributing factor for her being tired, weak, and lack of appetite. Probably not all of it but a contributing factor.
