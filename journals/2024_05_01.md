# A New [[NAS]] For Home
	- [[Proxmox]]
		- ### NO
			- Isn't even a NAS.  It is just a hypervisor where you would have to install one of the following for NAS.
	- [[TrueNAS Scale]]
		- ### NO
		- Uses ZFS as the only available file system which does NOT allow mixed drive sizes.
	- [[CasaOS]]
		- ### NO
			- This is just a glorified Docker front end.  It does NOT manage disks.
	- [[OpenMediaVault OMV]]
		- ### NO
		- OMV runs BTRFS and supports various sized disks it does not support Docker.
	- [[UNRAID]]
		- ### NO
		- This is the only paid solution which eliminates it from selection.
	- ### [[OpenMediaVault OMV]] + [[CasaOS]]
		- So OpenMediaVault is good at managing users and disk but doesn't have Docker support but CasaOS has Docker support but sucks at user and storage management.  How about installing CasaOS on top of an OpenMediaVault install.
			- There is a YouTube video from 'Hardware Haven' titled 'OMV + CasaOS' that attempts to do just that.  He appears to have some level of success.
