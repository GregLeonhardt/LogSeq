		- While it is obvious that I don't know what I am doing I never would have expected problems like I am seeing.
		- I have a strong suspicion that my initial problems were self inflicted.  The CPU/Motherboard I eventually sent back were in all probability good.  After getting a replacement, the new set did the exact same thing as the old one including booting into a blank screen.
			- However, after replacing the power supply unit all that stuff went away.
			- But even now I an seeing HDD read/write errors that make no sense.  Even on the M.2 drive.  The problems on the M.2 drive were so bad that I need to reinstall.  I don't know what is going on.
		- I am thinking about switching to OMV but there is no support for RAID 5 with BtrFS so I am not wanting to go there.
