# [[Louise Leonhardt Estate]]
	- All communications between Stacey (our lawyer) and Stephen (opposing lawyer) have stopped.
		- The last word from Stephen was that he was not agreeing to anything in regards to arbitration.  Up to then Stacey and Stephen were dotting 'i's and crossing 't's in preparation to arbitration.
	- Our only recourse is to file for arbitration with AAA which will require a $2,900 filing fee and eventually cost around $5,000.
	- Stacey also composed a draft letter to Stephen requesting all communication between him and his clients that reference the four of us.
		- We asked her to formalize the letter and send it.
	- A new invoice will be sent for time spent, build back a surplus for future expenses, and finance the arbitration with AAA.
