# A [[New Home NAS]]
	- Starting the installation of [[CasaOS]]
		- The install is very simple and it is up and running in just a couple of seconds.  There are problems though:
			- By default CasaOS uses '/var/lib/casaos' to store configuration information and '/DATA' to store application data.  I need to relocate these directories to '/srv/---'
				- I found a procedure to move '/var/lib/casaos' but nothing for '/DATA'.  At first I thought, no problem, I'll just make a link.  That doesn't work.
