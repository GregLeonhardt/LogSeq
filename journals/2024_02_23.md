		- Hello Stephen,
		  
		  At your suggestion I/we have sought legal counsel today, and it was not possible to do in 24 hours, especially on a Friday. As a result we are asking that the funds distribution not take place for at least 7 - 10 business days so that we may receive that guidance.  To be honest, since  the original deadline was placed at the very end of your letter it was not noticed until now.
		- In
		  preparation of that upcoming meeting, we are requesting a copy of the 
		  trust.  We also request an accounting of all funds in the trust 
		  including the unnamed investment accounts. Your letter does not include 
		  why the additional funds were deposited into this Chase account, and an 
		  explanation would be very helpful. In addition, your letter did not 
		  delineate what would happen if we do not sign the waiver.
		- We we were very taken aback by your letter, as it was not at all what was expected.
		- We apologize for the delay, as we were hoping to end this as quickly as Jane; however, that no longer seems possible.
		- Sincerely,
		- Joyce
