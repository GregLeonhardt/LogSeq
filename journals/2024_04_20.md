	- **08:48** Morning observations
		- Awake, Alert, and Talkative.
		- Between removing the central line, anti-biotics, and the bile duct cleanout, everything looks better.
		- On an insulin drip.
		- On medication to increase her blood pressure.
	- **09:26**  Just removed the medication to increase blood pressure.
	- **10:??** [[Hepatology]]
		- Going to kick her out of ICU and back to step down or the general floor.
		- Insulin drip is to stop
		- That's about it.
	- **11:??** [[Endocrinology]]
		- I guess nobody from the hepatology team checked with Endocrinology before stopping the insulin drip.  Endocrinology wants it on and it's their ballpark so back on it goes.
	- **12:00** I guess it is a good thing they are going to restart the insulin drip.  Glucose is going straight up.
	- **15:00** Insulin drip finally restarted and none too soon.  Glucose is over 400.
	- **16:00** Starting to come down.
	- **22:00** It's time to slow it down.  It has fallen to 110 and still falling.
	- **23:42**  Leveling out between 90 and 100.
