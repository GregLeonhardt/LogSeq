		- Hello Ari,
		  
		  We apologize for the oversight.  We are fine with Stacey meeting with Stephen Brower;
		  however, if I understand this email, it sounds like it is no longer necessary, since you have received a copy of the trust.  I would also like to clarify that the new meeting you are referring to here, is to the review the trust with us?  If that is the case, we would need to meet no earlier than we did the last time.
		  
		  Joyce
