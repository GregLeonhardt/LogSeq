		  Stacey won’t be able to do a consultation until the week of April 8th.
		  
		  Does this work with your timeline?
		  
		  Thanks,

		- Hello Ari,
		  
		  The other attorney originally requested a response by 2/19/24, which has obviously passed.
		  
		  Are there any other attorneys in the office that could assist? Otherwise, I will have to ask for the additional time and see what he says.
		  
		  Keep me posted.
		  Joyce Anderson

		- Greetings Joyce,
		  
		  The other attorney in our office is booking for the beginning of April too.
		  
		  If you can’t wait, I can provide names/numbers for other attorneys that may be able to assist you.
		  
		  Thanks,
		  Ari
