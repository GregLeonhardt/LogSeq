# [[Sandy]]
	- [[Endocrinology]]
		- New insulin schedule because her glucose levels remain so high:
			- Lantus: 20 units in the morning
			- Increase the sliding scale to SS:3
			- Carb offset remains the same at 9:1
	- [[PT]] came by for a follow up after the previous hospitalization.
		- Not going to schedule any appointments.  [She is fine.]
	- Went over to the medical center this morning for a blood draw.
		- Big backup had to wait about 30 minutes.
		- No idea what any of the levels are since the patient portal is down.
	- **23:21**   [[Hospitalizations]]I am sitting in the waiting room of the ER.  Sandy went to bed around 9:00pm saying she was tired and falling asleep.  Around 10:30 I hear moaning coming from the bedroom.  When I went in she was completely unresponsive.  Barely able to open her eyes.  I called 911, the paramedics came and now we are here.
