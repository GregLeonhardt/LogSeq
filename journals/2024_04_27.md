# [[Sandy]]
	- **02:44** While in the ER she had a seizure.  At least that's what the Doctors said and they were there when it happened.
		- It is likely this also happened back at the apartment last night.
		- Not much else to say other than they admitted her to the step down unit on the 5th floor.
		- Nobody is coming up with any theories why this is happening.
	- **09:07**  The step down nurse was just here and wants to transfer Sandy to ICU.  She is very concerned about Sandy's airway and lungs.  When she breaths you can hear congestion but she isn't making any signs of clearing like coughing etc.
	- **09:20**  Transplant Doctor came by and said they are going to move her to ICU.
	- **09:39**  [[Respiratory]]
		- Inhaler and breathing treatment.
	- **09:52**  In the ICU (8857)
