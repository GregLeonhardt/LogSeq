# Project Requirements
	- Build a management environment that will configure and manage a RAID environment.
		- Requirements:
			- The base file system will be [[BtrFS]]
			- RAID Level is self determining (User does not get to choose).
				- A combination of RAID-1 and RAID-5 will be used.
			- Any number of any disk sizes may be grouped.
			- Snapshot will be available in some form.
- # Experiment #01
	- Construct a simple RAID-01 with two drives the same size:
		- sdb - 5GB
		- sdc - 5GB
		- mount lv-01 as a 10 GB volume
	- Commands:
		- mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdXN
			- Where X is the drive letter (sda, sdb, etc.) and N is the partition number.
- # Resources:
