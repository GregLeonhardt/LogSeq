# Project Requirements
	- Build a management environment that will configure and manage a RAID environment.
		- Requirements:
			- The base file system will be [[BtrFS]]
			- RAID Level is self determining (User does not get to choose).
				- A combination of RAID-1 and RAID-5 will be used.
			- Any number of any disk sizes may be grouped.
			- Snapshot will be available in some form.
- # Experiment #01
	- Construct a simple RAID-01 with two drives the same size:
		- sdb - 5GB
		- sdc - 5GB
		- mount lv-01 as a 10 GB volume
	- Commands:
		- ``parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel gpt mkpart primary btrfs 0% 50% mkpart primary btrfs 50% 100%``
			- Start with an uninitialized disk and create two partitions of equal size.
- # Commands:
	- ``gprted -s /dev/sdb mklabel gpt``
		- This command will create a partition table on the drive.
			- ** *NOTE: This command will remove any and all existing partitions and data from the drive.  USE IT WITH CAUTION!* **
			  background-color:: yellow
	- ``sudo parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart primary btrfs 0% 50%``
		- This command will create a primary partition on the drive using the first half of the drive space.
	- NOTE: 'parted' commands may be stacked.  For example the above two commands could
- # Resources:
	- [VirtualBox image]([[VB-LHR]])
		- This is a VirtualBox development environment.
