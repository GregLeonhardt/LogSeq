- ***NOTE: BtrFS does not officially support RAID-5.  Their documentation lists it as "EXPERIMENTAL".***
  background-color:: red
- ### Drive initialization:
	- Use the built-in 'parted' command to perform the initialization.  It will create the drive label and create a primary partition.  Do this for every drive that will be added to the array.
		- ``parted -s {DRIVE-ID} mklabel gpt mkpart primary btrfs 0% 100%``
		- EXAMPLE:
			- ``parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel gpt mkpart primary btrfs 0% 100%``
	- ### Make an array:
		- #### RAID-1
			- ``mkfs.btrfs -d raid1 {DRIVE_1}1 {DRIVE_2}1``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``mkfs.btrfs -d raid1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1``
		- #### RAID-5
			- ``mkfs.btrfs -d raid5 {DRIVE_1}1 {DRIVE_2}1 {DRIVE_3}1``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``mkfs.btrfs -d raid5 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1``
		- NOTE: You do NOT mount the file system.  it will be imported from [[OpenMediaVault OMV]]
		  background-color:: gray
	- ### List all drives:
		- To list all drives that are part of a Btrfs filesystem or pool, you can use the `btrfs filesystem show` command. This command provides detailed information about the Btrfs filesystem, including the devices that make up the filesystem.
			- ``sudo btrfs filesystem show {POOL_LOCATION}``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``sudo btrfs filesystem show /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
					- Will produce an output something like:
					  ``Label: none  uuid: 71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305``
					  ``        Total devices 3 FS bytes used 25.98GiB``        
					  ``        devid    1 size 10.00GiB used 10.00GiB path /dev/sdb1``        
					  ``        devid    2 size 20.00GiB used 19.00GiB path /dev/sdc1``        
					  ``        devid    3 size 30.00GiB used 19.00GiB path /dev/sdd1``
	- ### Convert from RAID-1 to RAID-5
		- ``btrfs balance start -dconcert=raid5 -mconvert=raid1 {POOL_LOCATION}``
		- EXAMPLE:
			- ``btrfs balance start -dconcert=raid5 -mconvert=raid1 /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
	- ### Check the status of a balance:
		- ``btrfs scrub status {POOL_LOCATION}``
		- EXAMPLE:
			- ``btrfs balance status /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
- ### Expand an array by adding a new drive.
	- #### Identify New Drive:
		- First, identify the new drive you want to add to the Btrfs filesystem. You can use the `lsblk` tool to list available drives and partitions.
	- #### Partition New Drive:
		- If the new drive is not already partitioned, you need to partition it. You can use the 'parted' tool for this purpose. (*See above.*)
	- #### Add New Drive to Btrfs Filesystem:
		- Once the new drive is partitioned, you can add it to the existing Btrfs filesystem using the `btrfs device add` command. For example:
		- ``btrfs device add {DRIVE-ID}1 {POOL_LOCATION}``
		- EXAMPLE:
			- ``btrfs device add /dev/sde1 /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
	- #### Expand the filesystem to use the added space.
		- After adding the new drive, you need to resize the Btrfs filesystem to make use of the additional space.
			- ``sudo btrfs filesystem resize max {POOL_LOCATION}``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``sudo btrfs filesystem resize max /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
- ### Replacing a failed drive.
	- Recovering from a failed drive in a Btrfs RAID array requires careful planning and execution to minimize the risk of data loss and ensure the integrity of the filesystem.
	- **Identify the Failed Drive**: The first step is to identify which drive in the RAID array has failed. You can use Btrfs-specific tools like `btrfs device stats` or general-purpose tools like `lsblk` or `fdisk` to list the drives and identify the failed one.
	- **Replace the Failed Drive**: Once you've identified the failed drive, replace it with a new, healthy drive of equal or larger capacity. Follow any hardware-specific procedures for safely replacing the drive, such as hot-swapping or powering down the system.
	- **Allow Rebuild**: After replacing the failed drive, the RAID array will automatically begin the rebuild process to restore redundancy and data integrity. Monitor the rebuild process to ensure it completes successfully.
	- **Monitor System Health**: While the RAID array is rebuilding, monitor the health of the system and the status of the RAID array using Btrfs-specific tools like `btrfs device stats` and system monitoring tools. Look out for any signs of additional drive failures or errors during the rebuild process.
	- **Verify Data Integrity**: Once the rebuild process is complete, verify the integrity of the data on the RAID array. You can use Btrfs-specific tools like `btrfs scrub` to perform a data scrubbing operation to check for and repair any errors in the filesystem.
	- **Perform Regular Backups**: To mitigate the risk of data loss in the event of future drive failures or other unforeseen issues, establish a regular backup regimen for your data. Back up critical data to an external storage device or offsite location regularly to ensure redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities.
	- **Monitor System Health Continuously**: Even after recovering from a failed drive, continue to monitor the health and performance of your Btrfs RAID array and the underlying hardware regularly. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to any potential issues promptly.
	  
	  By following these best practices for recovering from a failed drive in a Btrfs RAID array, you can minimize the risk of data loss, ensure the integrity of your filesystem, and maintain the availability and reliability of your data storage infrastructure.
- ### Balance BtrFS data distribution.
	- Redistributing data across devices to ensure optimal performance and space utilization.
		- #### balance
			- ``sudo btrfs balance start {POOL_LOCATION}``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``sudo btrfs balance start /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### status
			- ``sudo btrfs balance status {POOL_LOCATION}``
			- EXAMPLE:
				- ``sudo btrfs balance status /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
- ### Scrub BtrFS to check data integrity.
	- Scrubbing is an important maintenance task for ensuring the integrity of your data, especially on RAID setups where data integrity is crucial.
		- #### start
			- To start a scrub operation on a Btrfs filesystem, you use the following command:
				- ``btrfs scrub start {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub start /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### status
			- You can check the status of the scrub operation using the following command.  This command will display information about the scrub operation, including progress, the number of bytes scrubbed, and any errors encountered.
				- ``btrfs scrub status {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub status /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### suspend
			- By suspending and resuming a scrub operation, you can temporarily halt the operation and then continue it later without losing progress. This can be useful if you need to free up system resources or if you want to schedule the scrub to run during off-peak hours.
				- ``btrfs scrub suspend {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub suspend /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### resume
			- To resume a previously suspended scrub operation, you can use the following command.  This command will resume the scrub operation on the specified filesystem from where it was suspended.
				- ``btrfs scrub resume {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub resume /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### cancel
			- If needed, you can cancel a scrub operation using the following command.  This command will stop the scrub operation before it completes.
				- ``btrfs scrub cancel {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub cancel /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
		- #### stop
			-
				- Once the scrub operation completes, you can stop it using the following command.  This command stops the scrub operation and finalizes the results.
				- ``btrfs scrub stop {POOL_LOCATION}``
				- EXAMPLE:
					- ``btrfs scrub stop /srv/dev-disk-by-uuid-71a84d92-2675-45de-b343-cd7565537305/``
