- Logseq operates as a to-do list too, as well as a notes app allowing you to create checklists and where better to bring that all into one location, a daily notes area. This daily notes is created automatically so that each day has an associated set of focus items.

		- Interstitial journaling is a productivity technique created by Tony Stubblebine. To my knowledge, it’s the simplest way to combine note-taking, tasks, and time tracking in one unique workflow. -- [Interstitial journaling: combining notes, to-do & time tracking - Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling)

	- Logseq Git Plugin is a plugin for Logseq that provides easy access to common git commands, and helps you keep your notes synchronized with a remote git repository.
	- With this plugin, you can:
		- Know explicitly if there are unsaved notes in the current repository and if they are synchronized with the remote repository. When there are unsaved files locally, the plugin will show a red indicator in the toolbar icon.
		- Quickly commit changes to notes. The plugin provides shortcut keys (mod+s) to perform commit&push operations.
		- Provide buttons to quickly execute common commands. Click the plugin icon, and the drop-down menu will show you some buttons to help you quickly execute commands (you can specify the desired buttons in the settings).
		- Prompt you if you have synchronized with the remote repository. The plugin automatically detects if the current repository is up-to-date and prompts when logseq starts and other times.
