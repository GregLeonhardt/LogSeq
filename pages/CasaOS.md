### Pre-Install:
	- When running under Open Media Vault (OMV):
		- The web interface for OMV must be changed as by default both OMV and CasaOS use port 80.
			- System -> Workbench: Port
				- Change from '80' to just about anything else.  '8080' is a good choice.
		- Create a subvolume for CasaOSs Docker containers.
			- Storage -> Shared Folders + (create)
				- Name: docker
				- File system: (use the pull down to select)
			- Create an automated snapshot copy using snapper.
				- ``snapper -c docker create-config /volume1/docker``
				- Edit '/etc/snapper/configs/docker' as needed
- ### Install:
	- ``wget -qO- https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash``
	- -OR-
	- ``curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash``
- ### Uninstall:
	- ``casaos-uninstall``
- # Move root folder (for OMV)
	- CasaOS (by default) uses '/DATA' as it's root folder.  The problem is that this directory isn't part of an OMV volume.
