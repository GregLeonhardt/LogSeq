- Libbitcoin is a multipurpose bitcoin library targeted towards high end  use. An ideal backend to build fast implementations on top: mobile apps,  desktop clients and server API's. The library places a heavy focus around asychronicity, speed and availability.
- It's enables a big scope for scalability as each component has its own thread pool. By increasing the number of threads for that component the library is able to scale outwards across CPU cores. This are vital as the demands of the bitcoin network grow.
- Libbitcoin can be leveraged with different design patterns depending on the task or application: javascript, python, PHP, Ruby and so on.
