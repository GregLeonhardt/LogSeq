Try it with a lemon/herb rice and sesame green beans. Letting the chicken \"steam\" in the pan gives it a nice texture."

Husband was unsure, my picky daughter didn't care for it but ate it anyway. Served with white buttered rice and sliced strawberries with a little sugar on them on the side. Very refreshing dinner. Sorry no photo."
